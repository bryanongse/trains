Problem Statement: How can we model passenger traffic at future MRT stations for enhanced urban planning strategies?

By utlising data from open sources (LTA Datamall, OneMap, Department of Statistics Singapore, data.gov.sg), we aim to develop a ML model that can better cluster and predict station features and passenger traffic patterns.
